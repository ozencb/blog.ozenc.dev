Rust, Haskell, OCaml, Elixir, Golang... I want to learn them all. But going through docs or books is not always that much fun, and I want to keep the learning journey fun.

I decided to use [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles as the bedrock for language learning; dedicating each event year to one language and documenting everything in a long series of blog posts as I go about solving these puzzles. This should provide a decent introduction to the language as solving these require knowing the fundamentals of the language; variables, types, methods, structs, control flow, error handling, loops, maybe even file operations and data processing. They do not seem to take you to other important subjects like async programming, network operations, 3rd party packages etc., but I can always do some extra projects for these if I end up liking the language.

I intend to learn the specifics about the language with simple searches to keep it concise.

The code will live in [this repo](https://github.com/Ozencb/aoc).

The first language of choice is Rust, and I will start from the 2015 event. On to learning!
