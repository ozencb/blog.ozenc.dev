## Part 1

Santa is trying to figure out which strings are naughty and which are nice.

Nice string rules:
- Contains at least three vowels
- Contains at least one letter that appears twice consecutively
- Should not contain these strings: `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, `xy`

I want to make a function for each rule, then check each string if it complies with all of these rules.
And an extra challenge for myself: make it as functional as possible. No mutable arrays, no side-effects.


```rust
use std::fs;

fn has_consecutive_chars(text: &str) -> bool {
    text.chars()
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .windows(2)
        .any(|c| c[0] == c[1])
}

fn get_recurring_char_count(text: &str, char_set: &[char]) -> usize {
    text.chars().filter(|c| char_set.contains(c)).count()
}

fn has_greater_number_of_vowels_than(text: &str, vowel_count: usize) -> bool {
    let vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];
    get_recurring_char_count(text, &vowels) >= vowel_count
}

fn contains_strings(text: &str, arr: &[&str]) -> bool {
    arr.iter().any(|str| text.contains(str))
}

fn main() {
    let forbidden_strings = ["ab", "cd", "pq", "xy"];
    let filename = "data.txt";

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).expect("Something went wrong");

    let nice_string_count = contents
        .lines()
        .filter(|line| {
            has_greater_number_of_vowels_than(line, 3)
                && has_consecutive_chars(line)
                && !contains_strings(line, &forbidden_strings)
        })
        .count();

    println!("{:?}", nice_string_count)
}
```

This all works nicely. I am still a new to the functional paradigm and I know that Rust wasn't designed with functional concepts in mind, but it is fun nonetheless. 

I want to keep introducing more functional concepts in these blog series as I learn more about it in the future.

## Part 2

For part two, we will have to make some significant changes to our code because the rules for deciding whether a string is nice or not are all different now.

A nice string must now have both:
- Pair/pairs of of non-overlapping letters appearing more than once .It can be `xyxy` because it has two `xy`s, or `aabcdaa` because it has a pair of `aa`s in it. But `aaa` does not satisfy the requirement because the `a` in the middle overlaps with two different `aa` pairs.
- A letter that repeats itself with another letter between them, like `xyx` or `bcb` or `aaa`
