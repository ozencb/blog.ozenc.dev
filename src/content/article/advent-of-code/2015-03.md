## The Problem

[--- 2015 Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/3)

## Part 1

Santa is delivering gifts to two-dimensional grid of houses. He gets instructions over the radio by arrow characters (`>`, `<`, `v`, `^`) and moves according to these. He delivers a gift in each move, but sometimes he gets wrong instructions and revisits some of the locations he has already visited. 

For the first part, we want to solve how many houses get at least 1 present. Starting location will also count as one present delivered.

For example, 

- `>` delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.
- `^>v<` delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.


If there is a data type that can hold non-duplicate items in Rust, like some sort of set, we can use it. We can iterate over the instructions, call a `move()` function that takes the direction character and either returns the next coordinate which can then be added to hash set. These coordinates can maybe be some sort of struct. I will also copy file reading stuff from [the previous challenge](/advent-of-code-2015-02).

```rust
struct Coordinate {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let starting_coordinates = Coordinate { x: 0, y: 0 };

    let new_coord = move_santa('v', starting_coordinates);

    println!("{:?} {:?}", new_coord.x, new_coord.y)
}

fn move_santa(direction: char, current_coordinate: Coordinate) -> Coordinate {
    match direction {
        '^' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x,
            y: current_coordinate.y + 1,
        },
        '>' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x + 1,
            y: current_coordinate.y,
        },
        'v' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x,
            y: current_coordinate.y - 1,
        },
        '<' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x - 1,
            y: current_coordinate.y,
        },
        _ => unreachable!(),
    }
}
```

This succesfully moved the character one line down, giving us `0 -1` for `x y`. I then tried to implement hash set like so:

```rust
let starting_coordinates = Coordinate { x: 0, y: 0 };

let mut visited_coordinates: HashSet<Coordinate> = HashSet::from([starting_coordinates]);
let mut current_coordinates = starting_coordinates;

for direction in directions {
    current_coordinates = move_santa(direction, current_coordinates);
    visited_coordinates.insert(current_coordinates);
}
```

But `insert()` function of hash set gave me the error ```the method `insert` exists for struct `HashSet<Coordinate>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied```. Naturally, it needs some way to compare `Coordinate`s so Rust can decide which ones are duplicates. 

```rust
#[derive(Eq, Clone, Copy)]
struct Coordinate {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl PartialEq for Coordinate {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Coordinate) -> bool {
        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y
    }
}

impl std::hash::Hash for Coordinate {
    fn hash<H>(&self, state: &mut H)
    where
        H: std::hash::Hasher,
    {
        state.write_i32(self.x);
        state.finish();
    }
}
```

I had to "extend" the functionality of `Coordinate` by adding hash and `PartialEq` functions and add three traits, `Eq`, `Clone`, and `Copy` to make it work.

With everything put together, we solve the first part of the puzzle.

```rust
use std::{collections::HashSet, fs};

#[derive(Eq, Clone, Copy)]
struct Coordinate {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl PartialEq for Coordinate {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Coordinate) -> bool {
        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y
    }
}

impl std::hash::Hash for Coordinate {
    fn hash<H>(&self, state: &mut H)
    where
        H: std::hash::Hasher,
    {
        state.write_i32(self.x);
        state.finish();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let filename = "data.txt";

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).expect("Something went wrong");
    let directions = contents.chars();

    let starting_coordinates = Coordinate { x: 0, y: 0 };

    let mut visited_coordinates: HashSet<Coordinate> = HashSet::from([starting_coordinates]);
    let mut current_coordinates = starting_coordinates;

    for direction in directions {
        current_coordinates = move_santa(direction, current_coordinates);
        visited_coordinates.insert(current_coordinates);
    }

    println!("{:?}", visited_coordinates.into_iter().count())
}

fn move_santa(direction: char, current_coordinate: Coordinate) -> Coordinate {
    match direction {
        '^' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x,
            y: current_coordinate.y + 1,
        },
        '>' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x + 1,
            y: current_coordinate.y,
        },
        'v' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x,
            y: current_coordinate.y - 1,
        },
        '<' => Coordinate {
            x: current_coordinate.x - 1,
            y: current_coordinate.y,
        },
        _ => unreachable!(),
    }
}
```
