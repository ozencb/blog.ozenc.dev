This is the first post of the Aoc 2015 with Rust series, which will be a documented journey of me learning Rust language. I am a professional software developer so I already know a number of programming languages. For that I reason, I intend to skip parts that are common in other languages and, instead, focus on parts that are new or cryptic to me.

I will primarily use [official docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) and StackOverflow for more specific situations.

Toolchain is ready and installed thanks to `rustup`. I will initialize projects with `cargo init`, which should give us the base setup to work on. Aand let's go!

## Part 1

Santa wants to deliver presents in an apartment building but for floor directions, all he got is a set of parentheses. `(` means one floor up, `)` means one floor down. `)())())` results in `-3`, and `))((((()` results in `2`.

Piece of cake. I can increment or decrement a counter as I iterate through the set of these characters accordingly.

I remember some basic stuff from my 15 minutes of Rust experience like how to declare variables, variables being immutable by default, the `mut` keyword, type inference etc. So I try some hello wordish things:

```rust
fn main() {
    let text = "oi";
    println!(text);
}
```

To my surprise, this did not work. 

```

```

Yeh, string literals...

```rust
fn main() {
    let text = "oi";
    println!("{}", text);
}

//oi
```

The method that I will use is `string.chars()`, which apparently returns an iterator (something that can be looped through), and with a `for` loop, I can check each character in the string and act upon it. The question also includes some warnings about Unicode characters, which can resolve to multiple characters (ex: `a̐` becomes `['a', '\u{310}']`), but since our input will only consist of parantheses, I don't have to take any measures against this issue.




```rust
fn main() {
    let instructions = "))((((()";
    let mut currentFloor = 0;

    for char in instructions.chars() {
        if char == '(' {
            currentFloor = currentFloor + 1;
        } else {
            currentFloor = currentFloor - 1;
        }
    }

    println!("{}", currentFloor);
}
```

I found that strings has a method called `chars()` which returns an iterator and, surely, running the code prints out `2` as expected. One minor hiccup
and surely, it prints out `2`. 

One minor issue I faced when comparing the character to an opening paranthesis was, characters are expected to be surrounded by single quotes, not double quotes but I tried the latter first and the compiler kindly warned me and steered me into the right direction:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:6:20
  |
6 |         if char == "(" {
  |            ----    ^^^ expected `char`, found `&str`
  |            |
  |            expected because this is `char`
  |
help: if you meant to write a `char` literal, use single quotes
  |
6 |         if char == '(' {
  |                    ~~~

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
```

Now is the time for taking an input from AoC and pasting it into the `instructions` variable, and run the code, hoping that it works as expected.

AoC gave me a very long string that resolved to `280`, and pasting this number into the solution box and sending it gave me this message:

```
Your puzzle answer was 280.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
```

Nice. On to part two!

P.S: At this point, I also realized that the compiler warned me about using camel case when naming the `currentFloor` variable, so I will keep that in mind for later changes.


## Part 2

The second part of the puzzle wants me to find the position of the first character that causes Santa to enter the basement (floor -1).

I want to simply add an index to the iteration, so I can pinpoint the exact location when Santa reaches the basement for the first time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let instructions = "))((((()";
    let mut currentFloor = 0;
    let mut hasReachedBasement = false;

    for (idx, char) in instructions.chars().enumerate() {
        if char == '(' {
            currentFloor = currentFloor + 1;
        } else {
            currentFloor = currentFloor - 1;
        }

        if !hasReachedBasement && currentFloor < 0 {
           println!("{}", idx + 1); 
           hasReachedBasement = true;
        }
    }

    println!("{}", currentFloor);
}
```

And it works! Part 2 of our puzzle is now complete.

#### Retrospective

~~The first blog post in the series turned out to be a lot longer than I wanted, and I found myself to be explaining basic programming concepts unintentionally, mostly because I am new to writing blog posts. I initially planned this series to be a "log", rather than long explanations, but here we are... I decided to post this blog as is, but going forward, I will try to keep it as concise as possible. Let's see how it goes.~~
