#### *Part List*

I put together this simple DSLR film scanning rig to re-digitize (some of the shop scans I have are horrid) my negatives, and scan new home-developed films. I went this way because:

- I had a DSLR laying around
- Decent scanners are expensive or hard to come-by where I live
- Second hand scanners are not guaranteed to break

Going this way, though, was not very straight forward as it needed some research, careful planning, and DIY work, so in this blog post I will try to write how I did the thing that's been done many times by other people.

# Need/No Need

Final result,

1. **Needs** to fit 35mm films in the frame nicely. Support for 120mm is a huge plus for future proofing
2. **Needs** to be easy to put together, and have few moving parts, and be sturdy
3. **Needs** to be a lot cheaper than dedicated film scanners for it to make any sense
4. **Does not need** motorization/automation. Speed is not a huge deal since finishing a roll takes weeks for me

# The Camera

Everything had to be built around the camera I have, a **Nikon D5100**. Its 16 megapixel APS-C sensor (not full-frame) produces decent enough results since I have no plans for doing large prints, and it has a swiveling screen which is nice for adjusting things without doing acrobatics.
