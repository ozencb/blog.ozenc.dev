#### *Part List*



---

I put together this simple DSLR film scanning rig to re-digitize (some of the shop scans I have are horrid) my negatives, and scan new home-developed films. I went this way because:

- I had a DSLR laying around
- Decent scanners are expensive or hard to come-by where I live
- Second hand scanners are not guaranteed to break

Going this way, though, was not very straight forward as it needed some research, careful planning, and DIY work, so in this blog post I will try to write how I did the thing that's been done many times by other people.

# The Camera

Everything had to be done according to the camera I have, a **Nikon D5100**. 16 megapixel APS-C sensor (not full-frame) does a decent job
