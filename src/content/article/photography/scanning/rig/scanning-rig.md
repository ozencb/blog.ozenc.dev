#### *Part List*

I put together this simple DSLR film scanning rig to re-digitize (some of the shop scans I have are horrid) my negatives, and scan home-developed films. I went this way because:

- I had a DSLR laying around
- Decent scanners are expensive or hard to come-by where I live
- Second hand scanners are not guaranteed to not break

Going this way, though, was not very straight forward as it needed some research, careful planning, and some DIY work. In this blog I will try to write how I did the thing that's been done many times by other people.

# Need/No Need

Final result,

1. **Needed** to fit 35mm films in the frame nicely. Support for 120mm would have been a huge plus
2. **Needed** to be easy to put together,  have few moving parts, and be sturdy
3. **Needed** to be a lot cheaper than dedicated film scanners for all this to make any sense
4. **Did not need** motorization/automation. Speed is not a huge necessity since finishing a roll takes weeks for me

# The Camera

Everything had to be built around the camera I have, a **Nikon D5100**. Its 16 megapixel APS-C sensor (not full-frame) produces decent enough results since I have no plans for doing large prints. It has a swiveling screen which is nice for adjusting things without doing acrobatics. Rest of the specs are just details, as they either exist in most modern digital cameras or they make no difference in this context.

However, the sensor being smaller than full frame is a limiting factor, which I will talk about in the next section.

# The Lens

At the time, I was hesitant about building a DIY rig since I did not have a macro lens and I thought decent macro lenses were as expensive as scanners but I found out that our local camera shops had many budget options. After some research, I purchased a second hand **Sigma 70 mm f/2.8 EX DG** (older non "Art" version).

APS-C sensors has a crop factor of 1.5x so its full-frame equivalent would be 105mm (`70 * 1.5 `). At 1:1 magnification, it means that

The auto-focus does not work with D5100 body but film scanning requires manual focus anyway, so it was not a deal breaker. I
